## Overview
**Mercury is a set of services, agents, and libraries designed for the 
purpose of managing datacenter hardware assets**

Mercury is not 'cloud' software. However, it can be used to deploy 
clouds onto physical assets.

Mercury is not configuration management. However, it's real time 
inventory databases can be used as back ends for many DevOPs workloads.

At a high level, Mercury is a protocol for interacting with physical 
assets in a 'pre-provisioned' state. The code herein is an
implementation of that protocol.

## Code structure
At present, mercury exists as a set of python packages which use the 
mercury namespace.
