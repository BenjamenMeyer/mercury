# Mercury
<i>Liquid Metal</i>

# Overview
**Mercury is a set of services, agents, and libraries designed for the 
purpose of managing datacenter hardware assets**

Mercury is not cloud software or an IaaS solution. Mercury is intended to extend the inventory and management
capabilities of these higher level applications. 

Mercury is the result of over 10 years of experience in the provisioning space at Rackspace, where we have built 
provisioning software for large, heterogeneous environments. 

# The Talk
This will be the second 'official' talk around Mercury, though, it has been demoed internally quite a bit. This talk 
will focus primarily on Mercury's 'at scale' capabilities and dynamic datacenter partitioning. I will be spinning up 
ephemeral environments for testing, deploying Apache Mesos and Kubernetes using Press images, launching tensorflow and 
spark frameworks; all on bare metal, in minutes. 
<br><br>
I will touch on single tenant provisioning and monetizing pre-provisioned nodes by utilizing them for secondary,
ephemeral workloads. I will talk briefly about Mercury's architecture and live hardware database, as well. 
<br><br>
Finally, I will attempt paint a picture (figuratively) of the possibilities that emerge with the existence of 
software like Mercury. Also, I will detail what we can expect in the coming months as we begin integrating our existing
provisioning systems with Mercury. 


# Notes
I will need to be able to create a VPN connection back to the mercury front ends. From there I will use pre-provisioned
nodes to perform the demo operations. I have most of this scripted out, console cowboy style. The time crunch will
ensure things stay entertaining. 

Thank you for your consideration!
